# Seth Friend — Portfolio

This is a lightweight, fast portfolio site you can host for free with **GitHub Pages**.

## Quick Start
1. Create a new repo named `USERNAME.github.io` (replace USERNAME with your GitHub username).
2. Download `portfolio_site.zip` from ChatGPT, unzip it, and upload all files into that repo.
3. Commit to `main` and push. GitHub Pages will publish automatically at `https://USERNAME.github.io/`.
   - If Pages is not on, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch → Branch: main**.
4. Edit `data/projects.json` to add/update projects. No build step needed.
5. (Optional) Add `resume.pdf` to the root so the Resume link works.
6. (Optional) Set a custom domain under **Settings → Pages** and create DNS CNAME to `USERNAME.github.io`.

## Customize
- **index.html** — text in the hero, About section, and navbar.
- **data/projects.json** — your projects, tags, and links.
- **assets/favicon.png** — replace with your icon (512×512 PNG works).
- **Style** — update the inline CSS in `<style>` in `index.html`.

## Tips
- Keep project blurbs short and results‑first.
- Put the most impressive projects on top of `projects.json` — order is preserved.
- Link to code, demos, and a PDF one‑pager when possible.

## Local Preview
Just open `index.html` in a browser. No tooling/framework required.
