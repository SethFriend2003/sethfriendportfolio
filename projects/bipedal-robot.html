    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
     I spent the last 4 weeks of my summer, after working at Amazon, trying to make a bipedal walking robot. The design takes strong inspiration from the robot used in VMP: Versatile Motion Priors for Robustly Tracking Motion on Physical Characters by Disney. I worked with a friend I met while working at Amazon, and we set out to make our own robot. I designed the legs, electronic system, and torso, while he designed the arms. All limbs have 5 DoF, with BLDC motors in the legs and servos in the arms. The body is made of a combination of aluminum plates, PETG, and TPU. The legs each have 5 Gim6010-8 motors with a built-in 9:1 gear reduction and ODrive clone driver. The motors are placed in the joints, just as Disney does for their bipedal robots. Currently, both arms and one leg have been assembled.
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>

      <p>
   This is still an ongoing project. Our next steps are to set up the CAN bus for the leg and then get the leg moving via a Teensy 4.1. Once that is done, we will assemble the whole robot and move on to simulating it in Isaac Sim to walk. Our robot has one IMU sensor and will use an 8GB Raspberry Pi 5 as its main processor. The current plan is to run the robot through ROS 2 Jazzy on Ubuntu 24.04.
  </p>
<h2>Progress!</h2>
          <p>
       The CAN bus for one leg has been finished and smooth movement with the leg has been achieved. The robot has also been successfully simulated in PyBullet. The next steps is to now simulate the robot in Issac Sim and finish assembling the whole robot (aka wire the 2nd leg).
