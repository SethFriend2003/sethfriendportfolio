    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
     This project had a lot of learning involved. The goal was to make a foam glider that could be remotely controlled with two ESP32 to make a glider hit a specific target. We were not allowed to use propellers because of school policy. This was quite a challenge because I had not done remote control between two microcontrollers before now, and also had never designed a plane. I had to learn about aerfoil design, as well as wireless communication protocals. I succesfully made a glider with turning controlled by two underwing servos, and won first place in our staff competition.

    <h3>My Planes Downfall (literally)</h3>

      <p>
    The downfall of my plane came from its heavy weight and lack of lift. Unfortunately doing the staff competition made it clear that servo controlled gliders without a propeller would be a very hard beginner electornics competition. My glider did the best, but no one's glider really "glided", so unfortuantely it was decided there would be no public student run version of this competition.
