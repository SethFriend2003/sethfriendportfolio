      I designed the handheld to be like a DS because it was one of my favorite consoles growing up. I built it around a Raspberry Pi Zero with a custom 3D-printed enclosure and buttons. I used GPIONext to make the rasberrypi zero register the buttons soldered directly onto it as an external controller. The game console is also called TIW 1 because it was designed as a display piece for TIW, the makerspace where I work.
