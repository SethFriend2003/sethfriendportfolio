    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
     This project involved a lot of learning. The goal was to make a foam glider that could be remotely controlled with two ESP32s to hit a specific target. We were not allowed to use propellers because of school policy. This was quite a challenge because I had not done remote control between two microcontrollers before, and I had also never designed a plane. I had to learn about airfoil design as well as wireless communication protocols. I successfully made a glider with turning controlled by two underwing servos, and won first place in our staff competition.

    <h3>My Planes Downfall (literally)</h3>

      <p>
    The downfall of my plane came from its heavy weight and lack of lift. Unfortunately, competing in the staff competition made it clear that servo-controlled gliders without a propeller would be a very hard beginner electronics competition. My glider did the best, but no one’s glider really “glided,” so unfortunately it was decided there would be no public student-run version of this competition.
