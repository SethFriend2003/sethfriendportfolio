    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      I spent the last 4 weeks of my summer after working at Amazon, trying to make a bipedal walking robot. The design takes strong inspiration from the robot used in VMP: Versatile Motion Priors for Robustly Tracking Motion on Physical Characters by Disney. I worked with a friend I made working at Amazon, and set out to make our own robot. I designed the legs, electronic system, and the torso. He designed the arms. All limbs have 5 DoF, with BLDC motors in the legs, and servos in the arms. The body is made of a combination of aluminum plates, PETG, and TPU. The legs each have 5 Gim6010-8 motors with a built in 9 to 1 gear reduction and odrive clone driver. The motors are placed in the joints, the same as Disney does for their bipedal robots. Currently both arms and one leg have been assembled.
    <h3>Next Steps</h3>

      <p>
   This is still an ongoing project. Our next steps are to get the CAN bus for the leg set up, and then have the leg moving via a Teensey 4.1. Once that is done we will assemble the whole robot and move onto simulationg the robot in Issac Sim to walk. Our robot has one IMU sensor and will have a 8gb Rasberry pi 5 as its main processor. The current plan is to run the robot through ROS 2 Jazzy on Ubuntu 24.04.
