    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This was our second year competing in the Robo Rumble here at UT. Both years I made a verticle spinner robot, with much more success the second year. I designed the chassi as well as the electrical system, and we used a premade weapon. We chose TPU for the whole chassi for its high energy absorbtion and impact resistance. Compared to our first year we actually almost had a whole extra pound of weight, and added an extra layer of TPU armor. We made it to quarter finals, and I belive we would have made it further if we didn't have a weapon mount design flaw.
    </p>
    <h3>The Weapon</h3>

      <p>
   Oue downfall was our weapon mount, as we were using the barrel of the motor to power the weapon. Our issue was the end of the motor was spinning in a small bearing pressed into a TPU upright. This worked fine in testing, but against actualy robots, the TPU upright would bend, and the motor would pop out. If we were to do it again, I would make the upright out of a more rigid material, to prevent this from happening.
