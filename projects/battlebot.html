    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This was our second year competing in the Robo Rumble here at UT. Both years, I made a vertical spinner robot, with much more success the second year. I designed the chassis as well as the electrical system, and we used a premade weapon. We chose TPU for the entire chassis for its high energy absorption and impact resistance. Compared to our first year, we actually had almost a whole extra pound of weight and added an extra layer of TPU armor. We made it to the quarterfinals, and I believe we would have made it further if we hadn’t had a weapon mount design flaw.
    </p>
    <h3>The Weapon</h3>

      <p>
  Our downfall was our motor mount, as we were using the barrel of the motor to power the weapon. The issue was that the end of the motor was spinning in a small bearing pressed into a TPU upright. This worked fine in testing, but against actual robots, the TPU upright would bend, and the motor would pop out. If we were to do it again, I would make the upright out of a more rigid material to prevent this from happening.
